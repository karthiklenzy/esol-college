		<h3>Maharagama</h3>
        <p>Conveniently placed between Maharagama and Pannipitiya, ESOL Maharagama branch is equipped with state of the art classrooms and empowered with a panel of teachers who have gone through extensive training programs to deliver proper knowledge on the English language for students who strive for excellence. The Maharagama branchâ€™s operations are run by a dedicated administrative staff who would be more than happy to help the students and parents who arrive at the branch in search of information on the academic process.</p>
        <p>Catering presently for a student count of more than 1000, the branch is welcome to accept more students under its guidance. Apart from their usual academic studies, our students have the luxury of sharpening their speaking skills through the newly started English speaking club that is set up with the intention of shaping students to be comfortable speakers of the language. Additionally, students who require help in learning or student related psychology issues can have the option of receiving counselling services at Maharagama branch as well.</p>
